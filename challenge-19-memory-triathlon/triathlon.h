// Memory Triathlon — public allocator interface (the frozen contract).
//
// The solver implements ONE thing: a custom allocator that serves three fixed
// size classes, given a steady-state ShapeTable at construction. The grading
// harness replays a recorded order-book allocation trace through it and times
// three legs:
//
//     score = P99(allocate) + P99(free) + P99(access)   [cycles, lower better]
//
// The three classes are the domain objects of a pointer-based limit-order book:
//   Order (64 B)  — one resting order
//   Level (128 B) — one price level (a queue of orders)
//   Shard (256 B) — one symbol's book (its bid/ask level maps)
//
// HOTNESS is a stable PER-SYMBOL property (0..10): all of a busy symbol's
// objects are read far more, throughout their lives. It is handed to the
// allocator at allocate() time and never changes for that object. The winning
// strategy co-locates a hot symbol's Orders+Levels+Shard so the hot working set
// stays L1/L2-resident. Hotness is only a HINT — ignoring it is legal (and is
// what the baseline does), it just loses the access leg.
//
// This header is frozen and public. The solver provides `tri::Allocator` in
// solution.h (see the required member signatures at the bottom).
