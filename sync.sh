# Sync common files and challenge scaffolding from the public hft-challenges repo.
#
#   * Pulls in NEW challenge directories that don't exist locally yet (the dir
#     list is read from UPSTREAM, not from what you already have).
#   * Mirrors every scaffolding file in each challenge — harness headers, CMake,
#     benchmark driver, replay/triathlon headers, README, fetch scripts, the
#     challenge.yaml, etc. — everything EXCEPT solution/.
#   * Never overwrites an existing solution/. A brand-new challenge's baseline
#     solution/ is seeded once so you have a starting point to edit.
#   * Self-updates: if upstream ships a newer sync.sh it adopts it and re-runs,
#     so script fixes reach you automatically on your next sync.
